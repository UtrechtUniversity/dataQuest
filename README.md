# INTEREST

The code in this repository implements a pipeline to extract specific articles from a large corpus.

Currently, this tool is tailored for the [Delpher Kranten](https://www.delpher.nl/nl/kranten) corpus, but it can be adapted for other corpora as well.

Articles can be filtered based on individual or multiple features such as title, year, decade, or a set of keywords. To select the most relevant articles, we utilize models such as tf-idf. These models are configurable and extendable.

## Usage
### 1. Preparation
#### Data Prepration
Before proceeding, ensure that you have the data prepared in the following format: The expected format is a set of JSON files compressed in the .gz format. Each JSON file contains metadata related to a newsletter, magazine, etc., as well as a list of article titles and their corresponding bodies. These files may be organized within different folders or sub-folders.
Below is a snapshot of the JSON file format:
```commandline
{
    "newsletter_metadata": {
        "title": "Newspaper title ..",
        "language": "NL",
        "date": "1878-04-29",
        ...
    },
    "articles": {
        "1": {
            "title": "title of article1 ",
            "body": [
                "paragraph 1 ....",
                "paragraph 2...."
            ]
        },
        "2": {
            "title": "title of article2",
            "body": [
                "text..."  
             ]
        }
    }
}    
```

In our use case, the harvested KB data is in XML format. We have provided the following script to transform the original data into the expected format.
```
from interest.preprocessor.parser import XMLExtractor

extractor = XMLExtractor(Path(input_dir), Path(output_dir))
extractor.extract_xml_string()
```

Navigate to scripts folder and run:
```
python3 convert_input_files.py --input_dir path/to/raw/xml/data --output_dir path/to/converted/json/compressed/output
```
#### Customize input-file

In order to define a corpus with a new data format you should:

- add a new input_file_type to [INPUT_FILE_TYPES](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/historical-news-sentiment/blob/main/interest/filter/__init__.py)
- implement a class that inherits from [input_file.py](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/historical-news-sentiment/blob/main/interest/filter/input_file.py).
This class is customized to read a new data format. In our case-study we defined [delpher_kranten.py](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/historical-news-sentiment/blob/main/interest/filter/delpher_kranten.py).


### 2. Filtering
In this step, you may select articles based on a filter or a collection of filters. Articles can be filtered by title, year, decade, or a set of keywords defined in the ```config.json``` file.
```commandline
 "filters": [
     {
       "type": "TitleFilter",
       "title": "example"
     },
     {
       "type": "YearFilter",
       "year": 2022
     },
     {
       "type": "DecadeFilter",
       "decade": 1960
     },
     {
       "type": "KeywordsFilter",
       "keywords": ["sustainability", "green"]
     }
   ]
 }

```
run the following to filter the articles:
```commandline
python3 scripts/step1_filter_articles.py --input-dir "path/to/converted/json/compressed/output/" --output-dir "output_filter/" --input-type "delpher_kranten" --glob "*.gz"
```
In our case, input-type is "delpher_kranten", and input data is a set of compresed json files with ```.gz``` extension.

The output of this script is a JSON file for each selected article in the following format:
```commandline
{
    "file_path": "output/transfered_data/00/KRANTEN_KBPERS01_000002100.json.gz",
    "article_id": "5",
    "Date": "1878-04-29",
    "Title": "Opregte Haarlemsche Courant"
}
```
### 3. Categorization by timestamp
The output files generated in the previous step are categorized based on a specified [period-type](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/historical-news-sentiment/blob/main/interest/temporal_categorization/__init__.py), 
such as ```year``` or ```decade```. This categorization is essential for subsequent steps, especially if you intend to apply tf-idf or other models to specific periods. In our case, we applied tf-idf per decade.

```commandline
python3 scripts/step2_categorize_by_timestamp.py --input-dir "output_filter/" --glob "*.json" --period-type "decade"  --output-dir "output_timestamped/"

```
The output consists of a .csv file for each period, such as one file per decade, containing the ```file_path``` and ```article_id``` of selected articles.

### 4. Select final articles
This step is applicable when articles are filtered (in step 2) using a set of keywords. 
By utilizing tf-idf, the most relevant articles related to the specified topic (defined by the provided keywords) are selected.

Before applying tf-idf, articles containing any of the specified keywords in their title are selected.

From the rest of articles, to choose the most relevant ones, you can specify one of the following criteria in [config.py](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/historical-news-sentiment/blob/main/config.json):

- Threshold for the tf-idf score value
- Maximum number of selected articles with the top scores

```commandline
"article_selector":
    {
      "type": "threshold",
      "value": "0.02"
    },
    
    OR
    
   "article_selector":
    {
      "type": "num_articles",
      "value": "200"
    }, 
```

The following script, add a new column, ```selected``` to the .csv files from the previous step.
```commandline
python3 scripts/3_select_final_articles.py --input_dir "output/output_timestamped/"
```

### 5. Generate output
As the final step of the pipeline, the text of the selected articles is saved in a .csv file, which can be used for manual labeling. The user has the option to choose whether the text should be divided into paragraphs.
This feature can be set in [config.py](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/historical-news-sentiment/blob/main/config.json).
```commandline
"output_unit": "paragraph"

OR

"output_unit": "text"
```

```commandline
python3 scripts/step4_generate_output.py --input_dir "output/output_timestamped/” --output-dir “output/output_results/“  --glob “*.csv”
```
